Running the project requires the following tools:
    - Contiki 2.7 - we did not test the project with other versions of contiki.
    - Cooja with the serial2pty extension.
    - Python3 with the paho-mqtt module installed.
    - Eclipse Mosquitto.

After these tools are installed, clone the github repository inside the contiki-2.7 folder. You should now be able to run the project.
